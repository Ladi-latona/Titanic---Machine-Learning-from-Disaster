# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This is a Kaggle machine learning competition. The task was to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). Two similar datasets were given. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.  The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. The job was to predict these outcomes.
